# Detorte Color Scheme for Vim
Detorte is a color scheme for Vim, which originates from built-in *desert* and *torte* color schemes. Detorte will behave mostly the same in both GUI and 256-Color terminal Vim.

Detorte has both a dark theme and a light theme, which are for your choice. :)

***
# Installation
Copy the files on your .vim/colors folder. Or alternatively, use a plugin manager such as Vundle, or Pathogen.

If you prefer the dark theme, add this in your `.vimrc` file:

```
let g:detorte_theme_mode = 'dark'
```

Or the light theme:

```
let g:detorte_theme_mode = 'light'
```
